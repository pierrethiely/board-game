# **How to play**

First of all, it's a **turn-based game**, which means, you'll do **ONE action** then your turn pass.

You can move  **horizontally** or **vertically** only, from **one to three squares**. 
**Get the weapons by going on them.** 
When the players are side by side, a **fight begin**. 
Choose your strategy : ***attack*** or ***defend*** ? 

  If you're **attacking**, you'll inflict the **same damage** as your weapon does. 
  If you're **defending**, you'll receive the **half of damage** that your opponent could have inflicted to you.

Wanna get a **revenge** ? Click on the **"Rejouer"** button !
